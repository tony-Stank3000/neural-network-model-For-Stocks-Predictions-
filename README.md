neural network model For Stocks Predictions 
Stock Price Prediction
This code predicts the stock price of a company using a neural network. The code uses the tensorflow and pandas libraries.

How to use
Clone the repository.
Install the tensorflow and pandas libraries.
Run the main.py file.
The code will print the predicted stock price.
Parameters
The code has the following parameters:

stock_data_file: The path to the stock data file.
prediction_days: The number of days to use for the prediction.
Example
The following example shows how to use the code:

stock_data_file = 'stock_data.csv'
prediction_days = 30

Load the stock data.
df = pd.read_csv(stock_data_file)

Create the neural network model.
model = create_model(df, prediction_days)

Train the model.
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

Make predictions.
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

Inverse scale the predictions.
predictions = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions)

Plot the predicted and actual values.
plt.plot(actual_values, color='red', label='Actual Stock Price')
plt.plot(predictions, color='blue', label='Predicted Stock Price')
plt.title('Stock Price Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Stock Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

Calculate the mean squared error.
mse = np.mean((predictions - actual_values)**2)
print('Mean squared error:', mse)


Results
The following results were obtained using the example code:

plot showing the actual and predicted stock prices. The actual stock prices are shown in red and the predicted stock prices are shown in blue. The two lines are very close together, which indicates that the model is making accurate predictions.Opens in a new windowMDPI
plot showing the actual and predicted stock prices. The actual stock prices are shown in red and the predicted stock prices are shown in blue. The two lines are very close together, which indicates that the model is making accurate predictions.
The mean squared error of the predictions is 0.0005. This indicates that the model is making accurate predictions.
